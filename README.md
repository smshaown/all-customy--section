# My Awesome Project

Welcome to My Awesome Project! This project is designed to help you understand how to add images to your README file.

## Adding Images

Adding images to your README file can make it more visually appealing and easier to understand. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Upload your image**: First, you need to upload your image to a cloud storage service or repository like GitHub. Make sure the image is accessible via a URL.

2. **Obtain the image URL**: Once your image is uploaded, obtain the URL that directly links to the image file. You can usually find this by right-clicking on the image and selecting "Copy Image Address" or a similar option.

3. **Insert the image in your README**: Now, you can insert the image into your README file using Markdown syntax. Here's an example:

   ```markdown
   ![Alt text](img/img1.jpg)
   ```
